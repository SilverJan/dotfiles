# dotfiles

This repo contains my personal dotfiles (created under Ubuntu 18.04).

## Usage

Switch to your ~ and run the following commands:

	git init
	git remote add origin https://github.com/SilverJan/dotfiles.git
	git pull origin master

This will maybe fail as you need to backup / remove the files that are going to be overwritten
